        subtitle1: 'How it all Started',
        initialInfo: `When I lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, I was blessed to teach in one of the most diverse schools in the area. Duc D’ Anville Elementary school is one of the most remarkable schools I have worked. At 2020-2021 school year I was a Pre-Primary lead teacher with 15 students and only 5 of them were Canadians while everyone else was from all over the world: Philippines, Mexico, Ethiopia, Syria, Pakistan and more. These children inspired me to write this book, which is based on a conversation that happened between two boys and myself. The phrase: “So, your skin is like a shield against the sun” is the exact phrase that came out of a Canadian 4-year-old boy after I explained to him how we get the color of our skin and why his friend who is from Ethiopia has such dark skin.  <br> Some parents and even some educators find it hard to talk about skin color and this book reveals how children can openly ask “Why are you black?” or “How come you’re white?” and not only get the answers that they need with no  hedges or “shh” but also embrace the differences that make every individual unique.`,
        subtitle2: 'Description',
        description: `Noah enjoys discovering the world with his best friend Akin. They go to school together and spend their time playing lots of games and fight the “lava” with their imaginary potions, shields and superpowers. One day Noah asks Akin why his skin is “black” and Akin responds by asking Noah why his is “white”. With their teacher’s help Noah and Akin find out that they are not white or black after all, but rather brown, just very different shades of it. Noah and Akin learn how families and ancestors; some tiny little things in our skin, called melanin; and the sun are the reasons why our skin has the color we see and that’s when Noah realizes that darker skin can also be a “shield”, not imaginary this time, but a very real shield protecting his friend from the sun! Noah now clearly sees his own and his friend’s real superpower.`,

        bio: 'I was born in Toronto Canada but left with my parents and older brother to go to Greece when I was less than 1 year old. I ’ve lived in Greece for about 29 years; studied Early Childhood Education and got my Master’s in Adult Education-Lifelong Learning from the University of Athens until I realized that something was missing. I decided to visit Canada (“Just for a year…just to see how it feels like to live there…”) I told everyone, and myself. But I fell in love… not only with my now husband but also with the East Coast. Two years in Nova Scotia traveling all around this beautiful province made me feel I need to stay more, see more, experience more. Since 2019 Canada is what I call home; now I live in Sturgeon Falls, Ontario with my husband and our beautiful daughter. I miss Greece a lot and try to go whenever I have the chance. Too many wonderful people there who are part of who I am. Too many breathtaking sceneries and special memories…',
